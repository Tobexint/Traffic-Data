## Goal
- To learn how to work with image and video data for object detection.

The focus will be on how video data can be converted to images, understanding bounding boxes for object classification, and using XML annotations to represent those bounding boxes.

### Objectives
- Load and organize the project dataset, separating images and their corresponding XML annotations.
- Extract frames from a video at regular intervals.
- Parse XML annotations.
- Visualize bounding boxes on image data.
